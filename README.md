### Why?

Most of the url shortner applications available online do not allow you to create custom short urls without buying a subscription. This motivated me to create a backend that allows users to create an account and manage their custom urls.

### Usage

There is a public web app available for use - [short url](https://shorturl.ishaandham.com/app/).
